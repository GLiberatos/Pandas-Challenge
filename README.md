# Pandas - Challenge
 
# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of school performance based on various factors such as school size, spending per student, type of school, and subject performance.

## Key Insights

- **School Size Impact**: Smaller schools (under 1000 students) show better performance in both math and reading scores compared to larger schools.
  
- **Spending Insights**: Higher student spending doesn't directly correlate with better academic performance.
  
- **Type of School**: Charter schools generally achieve better scores and have higher passing rates.
  
- **Subject Analysis**: Reading scores slightly outperform math scores, indicating potential areas for improvement in math.
